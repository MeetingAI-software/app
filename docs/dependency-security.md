# Dependency security

## Verification

Run `npm audit` from the repository root together with both applications' normal test, typecheck,
lint, and build commands. Do not use `npm audit fix --force`: major-version changes must be reviewed
and tested explicitly.

## Accepted development-only advisory

As of 2026-08-13, npm reports four moderate findings through this development-only chain:

`drizzle-kit@0.31.10` -> `@esbuild-kit/esm-loader` -> `@esbuild-kit/core-utils` -> `esbuild@0.18.20`

The advisory concerns esbuild's local development server. Syncmemos does not run Drizzle Kit or an
esbuild development server in production. Drizzle Kit is used locally to generate migrations, and
generated migrations remain reviewed artifacts.

The current npm remediation suggestion is a forced downgrade to `drizzle-kit@0.18.1`, so it is not
accepted. Recheck this exception whenever Drizzle Kit is updated and remove it as soon as a stable
release no longer includes the affected loader. Critical and high findings are not accepted.
